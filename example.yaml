# These are apps that need to be running for the app to work normally in

# The key is the name of the application, and the value is the mode it should

# We're actually just using YAML reference/anchor syntax to insert this block
# into the `modes` object below. It has no special meaning to the program, so we
# can use as many or as few of these blocks as we need.

# The different modes in which your app can run (on a dev or test machine).
#
# The idea is that every app should have one or two key modes (for example,
# "development" for when you want to hack on the app, and "dependency" for when
# you need it running but don't intend to change it).
#
# You may add custom modes for additional use cases, for example to include or
# exclude background workers, or to use placeholder data instead of some
# dependency.
#

  development:
    start-command: ["bash", "-c", "sleep 5; echo Starting devon!"]
